# Planetarium
A sample HoloLens app that uses spatial mapping to automatically place holograms within a room. This sample uses the HoloToolkit for Unity. This is the completed version (with modifications in profress) of the [Holograms 230 tutorial](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/holograms_230) from the [Holographic Academy](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/holographic/academy), which walks developers through a complete sample project, built in Unity, that demonstrates:

* Scanning a room to create a spatial mesh
* Importing the spatial mesh within the Unity editor
* Visualizing the spatial mesh
* Processing the spatial mesh to find planes (e.g. walls, floor, ceiling, etc)
* Testing the placement of holograms based on the processed planes
* Occluding holograms based on the real world sptial mesh
